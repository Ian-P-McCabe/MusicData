# MusicData

## Next Steps
- Read JSON from BSO website and put it into a single JSON file
- Write each season to a separate file (will use subprocess), then combine later with Python
- Work with JSON file (or part of the file using Pandas)
- Season runs ~October to May

1. Gather Data
2. Clean data

## Thoughts

To recreate most popular symphonies chart, simply create list of all works in dataframe and then get the count for each one

## Questions
Who are the most popular composers? Works of those composers?
Most popular solo instrument?
Trends in performances over time?
